I should add more space on the dial for the reduction as currently hte math is like decimal point which is
hard to input the reduction HOWEVER, you can still enter the reduction via - sign -10 etc.. however I need
to get the meter logarythmic or increase type so the dial extends to negative reductions not just positive db gains
